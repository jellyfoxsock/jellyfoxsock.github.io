  Don&#x27;t Get Overwatch 2 (as if this needed to be said)
</h1>
<right> <p class="subtitle"><strong>Published 2022-04-22</strong></p><br> </right>
<p>As you may have already seen, Activision-Blizzard is at it again. Overwatch 2 is on the horizon.</p>
<p>And you absolutely should not be supporting it in the slightest.</p>
<p>Seriously, I've put off writing this because I may inadvertently give it some publicity to the few of you who read these posts, but I just feel that I must say this as somebody who passionately enjoys games, and used to enjoy the first Overwatch back when I was still an egg with no concept of what a good video game actually is.</p>
<p>Please, for the love of <em>God,</em> do not get into Overwatch. Leave it.</p>
<p>The character tweaks are, at best, the bare minimum. At their worst, they fundamentally sandblast off anything that makes a character interesting to play in the original.</p>
<p>For my example, Doomfist:</p>
<p><img     
    style="display: block;    
           margin-left: auto;    
           margin-right: auto;    
           width: 70%;"    
           src="/assets/articles/overwatch/coomfist.jpg"    
           alt="doomfist"    
           title="Coomfist."><br />
</img><br />
<br></p>
<p>This is not a positive alteration to a character. </p>
<p>This is making a character fit into a niche that has already been filled in this game.</p>
<p>At least twice over. In more or less this exact same way.</p>
<p>Seriously, how many more shield tanks do they want to add to the game? We already had Reinhardt, then they added Brigette, and at least she was purposely added to fulfil said role.</p>
<p>This is taking what was already an incredibly disappointing post-launch character, and removing what fun there once was. And in pursuit of what? No, seriously, I want to know what is possibly seen as beneficial about a rework wherein the thing being reworked is homogenised further when half the champions (or classes, or heroes, or whatever the fuck they're called) in the game feel the fuckin' same. </p>
<p>This is not a team passionately reworking a game to perfect it. This is a group of people desperately searching for things to change about an already overly stagnant concept in order to keep it afloat and warrant a sequel that has no need nor purpose of existing.
This is like if Valve released a new Team Fortress 2 update, but instead of doing anything meaningful, they just changed all the classes to Spy, or something.</p>
<p>I seriously cannot believe that some people are heralding such changes as the second coming of Christ, implying that they shall be such a great change that will breathe new life into a dying soul.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Okay, for one - dead soul. Overwatch is dead as fuck and has been for actual years.</p>
<p>Secondly, if this is &quot;breathing new life&quot; into it, then every time I exhale a new fucking galaxy must be born. This is not only clearly low effort changes in order to re-use assets and overall make it easier to create a new game on less work and money as to maximise profits for the big dogs, but it's also making the game even more boring than it already is by, again, homogenising characters together.</p>
<p>They may be promising and teasing all of these character tweaks, but I assure you, the gameplay will be almost entirely identical, if not worsened, and it's being sold for full price yet again, built off of features that could have easily been added (or indeed, tweaked) in the prior entry. Because this absolutely reeks of the <em>Activision</em> part of <em>Activision-Blizzard.</em></p>
<p>You know what <em>else</em> absolutely reeks of Activision?</p>
<p>The fact that they are so brazenly releasing what is (or was) ostensibly an incredibly anticipated game in a series that makes them lots and lots of money directly following the fallout from a scandal.</p>
<p>Modern Warfare 2019? Released to cover-up the fallout following the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/09/activision-blizzard-hong-kong-china-boycott-blizzard-response">China Controversy.</a></p>
<p>This is no different on the surface, however, it's actually far more insulting and soulless than usual Activision activity once you remember the controversy they are trying to dodge.</p>
<p>A human life.</p>
<p>A human life taken of their own hand, due to immense bullying, trauma and harrassment.</p>
<p>A human life in the most dire circumstances, finding no better resolution from their situation than to completely end it.</p>
<p>It took a human life in order for Overwatch 2 to release.</p>
<p>Are you satisfied with that, reader? Can you seriously warrant a purchase, when you will be lining the pockets of those who are effectively murderers?</p>
<p>Do not forget what crime was committed to simply consume mindlessly; especially not for a product put together with such little care, passion and soul for anything beyond a pay packet. Especially one as execrable, lazy, needlessly delayed and undoubtedly soon-to-be underwhelming cash-grab as Overwatch 2.</p>
<p>If you genuinely believe that you would sooner play this game than save your money in order to protest against the inhumanity of this corporation - the corporation who are already fine for money and definitely do not need be kept alive with tongue-baths and blowjobs - then please, close this page. Fuck off. I don't want to associate with you. If you cannot go without playing fucking Overwatch in order to not align yourself with <em>murderers,</em> then I don't want you in my life, on my pages, or anything. You are actively supporting such malice if you fund it, and if you do so willingly, again, fuck off.</p>
<p>Apologies for making a bit more of a serious post, but I just felt the need to speak my mind on this matter. I seriously cannot believe that people are so extremely gullible as to fall for this shit. Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not support Activision-Blizzard. They are not worth your time, let alone your money.</p>
